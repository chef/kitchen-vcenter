## Clone types

### Clone type: full

This takes a VM or template, copies the whole disk and then boots up the machine. Default mode of operation.

Required prilveges:
- Datastore.AllocateSpace
- Network.Assign
- Resource.AssignVMToPool
- VirtualMachine.Interact.PowerOn
- VirtualMachine.Provisioning.Clone
- VirtualMachine.Provisioning.DeployTemplate

- VirtualMachine.Config.Annotation (depending on `customize` parameters)
- VirtualMachine.Config.CPUCount (depending on `customize` parameters)
- VirtualMachine.Config.Memory (depending on `customize` parameters)
- VirtualMachine.Config.EditDevice (if `network_name` is used)
- DVSwitch.CanUse (if `network_name` is used with dVS/lVS)
- DVPortgroup.CanUse (if `network_name` is used with dVS/lVS)

### Clone mode: linked

Instead of a full copy, "linked" uses delta disks to speed up the cloning process and uses many fewer IO operations. After creation of the delta disks, the machine is booted up and writes only to its delta disks.

The `template` parameter has to reference a VM (a template will not work) and a snapshot must be present. Otherwise, the driver will fall back to creating a full clone.

Depending on the underlying storage system, performance may vary greatly compared to full clones.

Required prilveges: (see "Clone mode: full")

### Clone mode: instant

The instant clone feature has been available under the name "VMFork" in earlier vSphere versions, but without a proper public API. With version 6.7.0, instant clones became an official feature. They work by not only using a delta disk like linked clones, but also share memory with the source machine. Because of sharing memory contents, the new machines are already booted up after cloning.

Prerequisites:
- vCenter version 6.7.0 or higher
- vSphere Hypervisor (aka ESXi) version 6.7.0 or higher
- VMware Tools installed and running
- a running source virtual machine (`template` parameter)
- for Linux, currently only `dhclient` is supported as DHCP client

Limitations:
- A new VM is always on the same host because of memory sharing
- The current driver supports only the "Frozen Source VM" workflow, which is more efficient than the "Running Source VM" version

Freezing the source VM:
- Login to the machine
- Execute the freeze operation, for example via `vmtoolsd --cmd "instantclone.freeze"`
- The machine does not execute any CPU instructions after this point

New clones resume from exactly the frozen point in time and also resume CPU activity automatically. The OS level network adapters get rescanned automatically
to pick up MAC address changes, which requires the privileges to use the Guest Operations API and login credentials. By default, the credentials from the
transport are used, but you can override these (`vm_username`/`vm_password`).

Architectural description see <https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2018/04/new-instant-clone-architecture-in-vsphere-6-7-part-1.html>

Needed privileges in addition to "Clone mode: full":
- VirtualMachine.Config.EditDevice
- VirtualMachine.Inventory.CreateFromExisting
- VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Execute
- VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Query

## Active Discovery Mode

This mode is used to speed up provisioning of kitchen machines as much as possible. One of the limiting factors despite actual provisioning time
(which can be improved using the linked/instant clone modes) is waiting for the VM to return its IP address. While VMware tools are usually available and
responding within 10-20 seconds, sending back IP/OS information to vCenter can take additional 30-40 seconds easily.

Active mode invokes OS specific commands for IP retrieval as soon as the VMware Tools are responding, by using the Guest Operations Manager
feature within the tools agent. Depending on the OS, a command to determine the IP will be executed using Bash (Linux) or CMD (Windows) and the
resulting output parsed. While the driver has sensible default commands, you can set your own via the `active_discovery_command` directive on the
platform level.

Active mode can speed up tests and pipelines by up to 30 seconds, but may fail due to asynchronous OS interaction in some instances. If retrieving the IP
fails for some reason, the VMware Tools provided data is used as fallback.

Needed privileges:
- VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Execute
- VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Query

Linux default:
`ip address show scope global | grep global | cut -b10- | cut -d/ -f1`

Windows default:
`sleep 5 & ipconfig`

## Post-Create Script

Post-create scripts offer a way to make VMs ready for connections by a Test Kitchen transport.
In some cases, the default firewall settings block immediate connections through WinRM. Post-create scripts let you remotely execute commands to enable immediate access through WinRM.

Add all of the required commands for enabling WinRM connections with the `post_create_script` property.
The Guest Operations API (VMware Tools) executes the commands from the `post_create_script`. The GuestOperatons endpoint does not require network connectivity, but it does require additional privileges in vCenter.

Enable these privileges in vCenter:
- VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Execute
- VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Query

The commands are executed with the credentials specified for the transport, which you can override with `vm_username` and `vm_password`.
The `post_create_script` default timeout is 60 seconds. Configure the timeout with `post_create_script_timeout`.

## Benchmarking

To get some insight into the performance of your environment with different configurations, some simple benchmark functionality was built in. When you
enable this via the `benchmark` property, data gets appended to a CSV file (`benchmark_file` property) and printed to standard out (`-l debug` on CLI)

This file includes a header line describing the different fields such as the value of `template`, `clone_type` and `active_discovery` plus the different
steps within cloning a VM. The timing of steps is relative to each other and followed by a column with the total number of seconds for the whole cloning
operation.

## 1:1 NAT Support

Due to limited IPv4 space, some enterprises use NAT to transform the VM IPs into a routable IP. As the driver cannot detect such a NAT automatically,
but has to rely on the IP retrieved by the Guest OS, this has to be handled manually.

Example:
```
driver:
  # ... other settings
  network_name: TEST-NET
  transform_ip: "ip.sub '172.16.', '10.25.'"
```

This example reassociates the VM to the separate VMware network "TEST-NET", which would provision addresses from 172.16.x.x to the VMs. In between
this network and the developers, there is a router with 1:1 NAT configured so that those machines will be reachable as 10.25.x.x externally.

Any passed Ruby code will be executed with the `ip` variable (as discovered by VMware) available. The returned value will then be used as new IP.
As you can use arbitrary Ruby code, it is possible to do complex arithmetics or even implement remote API/IPAM lookups.

The Windows default behavior allows only WinRM connections from the local subnet.
There are two options for a 1:1 NAT situation, either open up the firewall at the time you create the template or open it with a post-create script, for example:

```
platforms:
  - name: windows2019
     driver:
      template: windows-2019_rtm
      post_create_script: |
        netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="Windows Remote Management (HTTP-In)" profile="Public" new remoteip="any"
```

For more details, see the `Post Create Script` section of this document.
